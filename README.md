# Redux Toolkit Project - From Concept to Practice 🚀

This project was built based on the tutorial **"Redux from CONCEPT to PRACTICE! Migrating from Old Redux to Redux Toolkit (Tutorial)"** by Coffstack. The goal is to demonstrate the implementation of Redux in a ReactJS (or React Native) app, exploring both Old Redux and Redux Toolkit, and migrating from one to the other in a simple and practical way. 🔄

## What will you learn? 🤓

- **Core Redux concepts**: Action, Reducer, Store, Dispatch, Global State, and the Redux Data Flow. 🔄
- How to implement Redux in your ReactJS or React Native app. ⚛️
- How to use Old Redux with HOC `connect`, `mapStateToProps`, and `mapDispatchToProps`. 🔌
- How to migrate to Redux Toolkit using `createSlice` and `configureStore`. 🔧
- How to use the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks instead of the old Redux. 🎣

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **ReactJS** ⚛️
- **Old Redux and Redux Toolkit** 🔴🔧
- **React-Redux** (for integrating Redux with React) 🔄
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** 💻
